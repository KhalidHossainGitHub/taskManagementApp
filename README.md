# Task Management List

The **Task Management List** is a simple yet functional to-do list application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This is my first project utilizing JavaScript to add interactivity to a web page. The application allows users to manage tasks effectively by adding, editing, deleting, and organizing them into different categories: All, Pending, and Completed.
